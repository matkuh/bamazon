### I created an amazon-like storefront with MySQL that allows customers to purchase items, shows them the cost of the purchase, and then updates the store with the new quantity.  I also added a few manager functions that allows that person to check low inventory items (less than 5 stock), add inventory to an item, and add a new item to the store.

## Tech I Used

1. [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)
2. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
3. [MySQL](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mysql/)
